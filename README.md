# NBA-Salary-Prediction
Predicting the salaries of NBA players based off their player stats

This project aims to explore how a wide variety of NBA statistics can be used to predict the salary of an NBA player from 1995 to 2017. My goals for this project are to:
- Discover which statistics are the best predictors of an NBA playerâ€™s salary
- Use a machine learning model to predict NBA salaries
- Determine which players have been overvalued and undervalued according to their given vs. predicted salary
- Determine which teams are the best and worst at extracting value from their players and if there is a correlation with the amount of games a team wins
